# Front Interview Exercise

Welcome to the Modulr coding exercise!

## Setup

Make sure you're able to run an Angular 9 application, you will need a minimum NodeJS version of 10.13. This application is configured to use Jest, rather than Karma for testing.

Clone the repo and run ```npm install```

Once installed run ```ng serve```

## Requirements

Try to recreate this design as closely as possible in the time given, you are free to search online for help, but we are keen to see the features that Angular offers being put to use.

Use the data provided (cards.json) in the assets folder to populate the cards.

We are not looking for a full implementation of everything so think about the areas you want to focus on.

Here are some pointers to consider while implementing a solution:

- Which Angular features will you make use of?
- How will the data (cards.json) be provided and consumed?
- How can the user navigate to the page you have created?
- How can you make the solution responsive?
- How can you identify and represent different card types & statuses?
- How would you test the solution?

## Assessment

Your submission will be used in the next part of the interview process to discuss your approach and implementation.

## Submitting

Once done, please zip your project, do not include node_modules or the dist folder and upload it to the link link we sent you.

## Try to avoid forking or hosting your solution on a public repo

Please take sensible steps to avoid other candidates being able to view your submission.
